python3 text_client.py <script path>

Our Creativity component was creating a custom console program (cconsole.py) that allows
the user to type and send messages while messages are coming in. In a normal terminal,
when data is printed to the screen while the user is typing, their message is cleared,
which is undesirable in an instant messaging application. We also added colors to our
outputs to make them more readable and nice-looking.
